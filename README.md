This code project uses OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and CVZone for gesture recognition. With the help of Pynput and mediapipe, I can simulate keyboard inputs to control the arrow key up, down, left or right depending on my hand gestures.



HOW TO USE for controlling the up, down, left and right using hand gestures when the palm is facing in front of the camera,


All 5 fingers OPEN   ---   UP Arrow key (pressed)

All 5 fingers CLOSED   ---   DOWN Arrow key (pressed)

2 fingers OPEN   ---   LEFT Arrow key (pressed)

1 finger OPEN   ---   RIGHT Arrow key (pressed)
